Fracking of the Rustic.T-Well<B-Hu!>would potentially cause an Earthquake:</p>
<h3>Citation:</h3>
<p>IPAA<a-r>: Induced earthquakes are more commonly linked to wastewater injection ‚Äî a completely separate process from fracking.
Most notably, a landmark 2016 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study concluded that, ‚ÄúHydraulic fracturing operations
are unlikely to generate sufficient pressure to drive fluids into shallow drinking water zones.‚Äù The EPA reached this conclusion even
after expanding the definition of fracking to include a wide range of other oilfield activities, demonstrating the safety of the entire
development process.</p>
<h3>Theory:</h3>
<p>*A common mistake in calculating the quadratic equation, even with the correct inputs, is taking the sqrt of the entire term ( b2 - 4ac ) / 
( 2a ); correct instead is to take the sqrt of only the terms ( b2 - 4ac ) and to divide the result of that sqrt function‚Äôs output by 2a. ** 
A second common mistake is neglecting to divide the term to the left of the operator ¬± on the right side of the equation, -b, also by ( 2a ). 
The quadratic equation allows us to eliminate one of the answers, depending on whether the operation + or - is applied from the ¬±, based on the 
parameters of the solution; since the hypotenuse of the right side triangle is only 16, the length of h, a non-hypotenuse side, cannot exceed the 
hypotenuse, and therefore we can eliminate 32.8cm as a possible answer, leaving only 7.2cm. |=P Therefore, we have confirmed x = 7.2cm in both 
the left side and the right side triangle by using the pythagorean theorem in conjunction with the quadratic formula to solve for the right side 
triangle. |=P As a final check, we can see that 7.2cm + (20cm - 7.2cm) = 7.2cm + 12.8cm = 20cm, returning the length of the composite triangle‚Äôs

	FEN.convert-run POSTs the FEN.input-field to step.1-analysis,func, and the page refreshes, containing, now, no longer the FEN-str, but the B.C-output, and 
		POST to E-stacker input; once E-stacker is run, only those inputs, but not the B.C-output, will be forwarded to the 3rd-Instance of the pg, after a 2nd 
		refresh. In order to preserve the 2.lost-strs #: the og-FEN, and the B.C-output, these need to be included # in what is POST‚Äôd to the next pg-Instance, 
		through a refresh, and POST, the best option, over _GET for this, and AJAX is extraneous, being as this is the same pg-instance that does not last # 
		Also, since this is stepwise so far, we can simply # include these lost-strs, as ghost-variables # <p-f> inside the resulting Form, which is all of which that is # POST‚Äôd
	Note that you may put multiple tokens in the token parameter. The string will be tokenized when any one of the characters in the token argument is found.
		^strtok can take multiple tokens as either-or: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtok.php
		Use .= # to first concatenate the 2-strs from f-s, then run the tok into a looped echo # <Turing> into clickable Form drop-down fields #  
		Once this is done, and the form fields can be POST, and we have ghost-vars of the lost-strs, I can write the M-classes and the actual E.stack-analyzer;

<!-- Issues / to do:
12.31-22,5th.1: 
	The var for each zi-print generated by FEN-convert is a string; this string needs to be converted to an array PHP-‚ö†Ô∏è before a for.each-op can be performed #
		Str-Tok can be used to generate an array, but this might be redundancy # ~10%<acceptable> 
		IIRC, strtok can be echoed-direct, and we can use "," as the delimiter # after clipping the initial [ and prec # 
		Question: How do I use str-tok with 2 different delimiters? 
	The Script-RAM is uncertain; at what point do the filled-vars, which are echoed, empty? Some subseq-funcs retro-depend on these vars,filled # 
		Presently, I use no db-writes to maintain a mid.long-RAM<Èù©Êñ∞!><90%done>
	<related-prec>‚ö†Ô∏è Clicking "Calculate" empties the C.U-B,C.output; var-RAM,fill.uncertain<80%>; page most-likely# refreshes 
	In the test-pos for E-Stacker, d5 is a Moment<ch-40>but it is Á©∫; the E of d5, on e6 | f5-P | c6-N<abs-pin>, subseq-e5<Á©∫>
		Sequential action: each Output by Analyzer should prompt user for neural-comp, subseq, another input, to trigger-AI # <ÂØπËØù>
		Therefore, the E-output,stacker should fill the input options # <partial> for Anki-reps # 
		Also, consider this: as the user will pause after each Form Submission<HTML>, we can use the time before their next.Form-submit to offload-comp
		Not every run will go to prog-term, as it is the goal, of each step, to compr # 
	Idea: add another zi-analysis, after compl-1 
	Idea: add some color, emoji for vis-highl
	Idea<seq-act>make Effect-Stacker self-referencing continuation<ch-59>; source.E-zi, themselves, clickable, to generate +analysis # 

// open-source this # 

Skip Castling ability, unless the position has some special-char # that is test-worthy #
"En passant" notation appears only when-req; can skip all subsequent "-"
Termination: terminate after both file and rank counters have reached 8, and read one more char thereafter: side to move # 

Hn+1S1: Catching POST same page demonstrates a micro.inner-RAM # 

Copy icon; test this later: https://stackoverflow.com/a/63600698 attempt-1 12.31-22,4th.17: could not get it to work on <p>

Rather than use PHP-break in the for-main, which would add an extra CPU-unit per loop-run, in this long.run-func, we can add a single
post-processing step using some sort of str.recog-cut | 

Post-processing: aggregate Pawns, easiest to do it within the loop, if the char is specifically a "P", and have a "P_f_" and "P_S_"
We can even aggregate all the zi and display such B[e8, d8] K[g8] N[d2, b2] and so forth # and these can be displayed # in a thematic order:
B, N, Q, K, R, P | Eg: B[f4,c1] N[f3,g1] Q-d1 K-e1 R[a1,h1] P[a2-b2-d4-e3-f2-g2-h2] 
Note: the post-processing can also be PRE-processing, 

Hu: This is assembly<x.ref-internal[fbno],helper>multiple-level # 

Parlay: Blind-chess.com, where you can # submit moves in sequence, generate links to send # and games are entered by a secure ID, 
can even enter IP addresses for extra-sec, self-responsible, db, 

Build a controller that echoes a "hidden" attr to the <p> that will display # the output B-C, if no $_POST,yet https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/att_hidden.asp

Add email capture + page counter if I put this online # 

Build a deeper analyzer before E: P-str, etc; what would be lightest? And, I can use my bl-string, and generate these analyses, without a board
	and also generate "higher-IQ" tables, dichotomous trees, and otherwise diagrams, with colors, and highlighting. 
	Hu: Going deeper, into an interest area, excavating MIC, pushing to book, excerpt to sections, will help me bullet analyses for others #gold?
	PNG to FEN, PNG to board code, with analyses # 
	
Build a legal move checker next, where a FEN input is stored in RAM # and you can type in a move in algebraic #<firm>to check for feedback #
