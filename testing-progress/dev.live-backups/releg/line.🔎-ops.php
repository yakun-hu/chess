[Late.22-6th,27]
	POST a single legacy array from analy-1<mRNA>; from this, instansh all objs, E_assoc, and 2/3 line-subs upon UI of analy-2 
[Earlier]
	The dest-zi need to have an instans'iden
		Use $lim for K, P-sear 
		Think: a 2x2 occ.only-matrx; I'm only searching among the C.u-b,chars which dis-incl's Nul
		Drop.down-show the anith; nomencl-all E from that zi at 1nc
	If all zi are repr(Up-cas), then "b" idens a file; I can indx the array 
		When a b is found, that loc will be reg'd; then we have: from b7-R: 
			[b2, b4, b8, e7] are all and the only occ # these sqs can be cal'd "vanish", then re-attributed by occ, post-查找 #paten 
	An Aesthetic Form would be an assoc_array of zi & sqs; ie f-B ==> e7
		This array can be passed and stored in the refr<Fran>as a $varPOST 
		Variables are cheap, so is CPU in the first step # I can make a foreign key'd set of arrays that are themselves_assoc'd, db-lite 
		AJAX? or $_POST ["array-str"]; alt: an assoc_array of arrays f-B [e, 7] [UB-21] 
		The full-sq is the only Primary Key<SQL-22>of the chess-boar 
	array_push($post_assoc, $side-$Zi[Key], array(网格[0], 网格[1], sum))
		Loop thru the array of values of $post_assoc for sub-index(1 or 2 
	3-4 arrays: 1) square.key-attr[zi-assembl,upd] 2) array of unique files [key: e, val(s): 3,7] 3) array of unique ranks 4) square.key-E 
		The line-ops will loop through the 2/3 arrays, and update 4) therefore, 1-3 will be assmbl'd in analy-1 
		2 array joined by f-key is analo to (attr, attr array(E1, E2 E3) all as values S
		The count of E, o and d, can be stored in posted_assoc, and the list-gran, in E_assoc # 
		E_assoc can be decl'd as a "snapshot" as its ini-state from posted_assoc, before further attr'd
			PHP:function.array-keys.php 
		Move: update arrays with lost E, and add Es # 
		Note, I also instanshi objs for each zi<mo-continu>; within each, the opportu for Array and the demand of effic 
		Assoc_array pass to obj
	Then, let the 2 key'd arrays be props'sq, and the objs, props-zi -->
