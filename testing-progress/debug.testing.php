		echo$类对->财产["side"] for each obj is fil'd all.E-Chu is corr, and we know d6 has issue, and this sq should rec 1$ from e7-Q, so there is an issue within 接_歪, or its call # 
		more Q.diag-issu: d4 should <1:0>, not reg'd; b2 should have 0.5$, not reg'd | f6 corr-rec 1$ from the e7-Q | Ps<f2,g3>seem ok, on lim'd vect; the diag-issu can be dir'bias, reca 接_歪 covers onl r-nobs the Q's straight line has no issues
		dive: 接_歪 接_歪 cont' 推加 call; there'm be a unrepo data.typ-mism #logikc-err in a/b test when the e7-Q is remo'd the d6 bump <1.5:0> to <2:0>, so the e7-Q dir or indir has a subtr-E when e7-Q is sole nob, d6 count-prop # 
		a compl err from a conflu-intera E_Chu is fed by zi; each zi's Chu shud be proc'd sep | 1) interf of the zhi-sqs<Q> 2) vars not unset bet/w func-calls 2Qs not  K, also interf 
		the same interf is repro'd when a B-pres, in-pl e7-Q: d6-P<0.5:1> nawwo-firm<接_歪=>gen> why is there a cross-interf? all the args to 接_歪 are of $this-$类对->E_出,$类对->财产["地点"],$类对->财产["side"])
		Array ( [0] => 0.5 [1] => 1 ) E_sums ar corr singl.var-err f6[0.5_]d6[0.5_] echo$方向[0][0]."[0.5_]"; in 接_歪 in the pur'ty all echo's corr;

		d6 should appear 4th in 推加 log, only 3; theref, we're missing 1 d6-call from 接_歪 wait: the d6-echs are all e_sum, not just 接_歪 
		the issue reprods when B-e5; theref, the Q is confusn' the e.5-7 Bs, onl, as an int of vert and not runn' the [0][0] line of E_Chu, in this cas, in the dir-E 
		a bizarre culpr # ✅W:e5✅W:d6 for the f6-Q ah, but that dir is W, for that Q # neverthl, e5 is not in range and e5 should be sort' SW; is also?
		print_r($观点);print_r($方向); in revels: only the e5-B has any attr diag-E; f6-Q has no registry 接_歪 a seconderr
		so the d6-P recs 1 full from e.5-7,B by diag, and 0.5 by a zhi from f6-Q<wr>due to e5-conf in W | reason: I feed E_Chu of the Q full into 接_查 incl the diag-sqs 
		the W check: the conf'er has to be in the Q's rng abs; any-e but 5/7 not the dum 接_查 func fails to elim e5/7 as because it doesn-elim<v-t>, it only sorts 
		I can add a redund-check, for Q-scen there was un.autre-probl ^ e5, the suposed.diag-E of the f6-Q, dos appr in f6's-lvl:e_chu only e5 calls 接_歪, at all<v-weir>
		P_嫁Q_界B_使 are the 专名 but only the B passes | bc: the Q is capt'd by the first if ! same iss i had earl w/ 并行歪找 calls there needs to be: "and if"
		bifur'接 calls in 找考; now, the West-err -->
