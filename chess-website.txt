Show board checkbox with 3 design options: show all pieces, pawns only, nobles. Show weak squares. Click on square to calculate E. Click on Zi to see rays of E, colored arrows # Determine checkmate # 
Higher value nobles that are under attack by lower value nobles. 
Am I in check? 
Material count: difference, each side. Total E. Cite ch-# for each analysis in analyzer dash.

If in check, list moves that get out of check, and the category of check-escape; likewise, for any piece check, from a list, drop down all ways to run those # 
Multiple move solution puzzles with one solution, or more than one solution on ply forks # likewise, in the board manipulator, store variations, download, and render a new b-code or FEN upon req #
